# Stroke-prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict stroke risk using clinical data based on the dataset from Kaggle. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and deployment of a web application for predictions.
## Project Structure
- data/: Contains the dataset
- notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling
- models/: Contains saved models
- scripts/: Contains Python scripts for data preprocessing and modeling
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.12.4
- pip3
## Installation
To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage
To run the Jupyter notebook, execute:
jupyter notebook
Open the stroke_prediction.ipynb notebook to see the data analysis and modeling steps.

##Data
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and contains information about patients, including their age, gender, medical history, and whether they have had a stroke.

##Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 94.03% on the test set. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the stroke_prediction.ipynb notebook.
